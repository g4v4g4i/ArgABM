; three different kinds of turtles
; arguments and starts form the landscape
; researchers are the scientists that explore the landscape
breed [arguments argument]
breed [starts start]
breed [researchers researcher]

; two different kinds of relations on the arguments
; a discovery relation and an attack relation
directed-link-breed [discoveries discovery]
directed-link-breed [attacks attack]

; the trees have to be connected in order to be visible
undirected-link-breed [starters starter]

; connections between researchers are undirected
undirected-link-breed [collaborators collaborator]

; properties of the arguments, each argument "knows":
; the theory it belongs to, during the setup if it should
; be considered, how many ticks an researcher was working on it
; and when it was fully researched (when it turned red)
; the roots also know how many researchers are working on that theory
starts-own [mytheory current-start myscientists researcher-ticks full-research]
arguments-own [mytheory current-argument researcher-ticks full-research]

; every researcher keeps track of how often it thinks
; that it should jump to another theory, how many times it jumped,
; the social network it belongs to, its current subjective landscape,
; the current best theory, if it received information at the current time
; the information in its neighborhood, whether it moved, if it is the representative
; researcher of its network and the new arguments/relations that are to be added

## Interface

Buttons

* _setup_ creates the landscape, including attacks and distributes the scientists/researchers over this landscape

* _go_ lets the program run one time step

* _go (infinite, has a small circle)_ lets the program run infinitely many steps, or until the button is clicked again

* _go-stop_ lets the program run until all researchers are working on a fully researched theory

Landscape settings

* _number-of-theories_ sets the number of theories/trees that will be created

* _theory-depth_ sets the depth of the tree

* _attack-probability-best_ the probability that an argument of the objective best theory has an incoming attack

* _attack-probability-2nd_ the probability that an argument of the 2nd theory has an incoming attack

* _attack-probability-3rd_ if there are three theories, the probability that an argument of the 3rd theory has an incoming attack

Strategy settings

* _strategy-threshold_ defines the threshold within which the number of admissible arguments is still considered good, if this threshold gets higher, the interval of acceptable values gets smaller

* _within-theory_ here the kind of collaborative network is set to researchers that start on the same theory (on) or randomly chosen researchers (off)

* _social-actions_ here the behavior of the researchers that communicate with researchers outside their own can be set: "reliable" is the setting where they share all information about the current theory: including attacks; "biased" researchers do not share the attacks to their current theory

* _network-structure_ determines the structure in which the collaborator-networks are connected and with how many researchers information is shared

Plots

* the _Popularity_ plot shows for every theory the number of researchers working on it

## Some language definitions

_Discovered arguments_: an argument that is not gray anymore nor turquoise (discovered by discovering an attack relation)
_(Not) fully researched arguments_: the level at which an argument is explored, a fully researched argument will be red
_Root/start_: refers to the root of a theory

## Setup of the landscape

### Building the objective landscape

For each theory a tree is built, its root is called "start". The depth of the theory, as can be chosen in the interface, sets the number of arguments. The root has 4 child-arguments, after that, if a next layer exists, each argument has also 4 child-arguments, otherwise 0. Each of these child-arguments is connected by a directed discovery relation.

Each argument has a memory for the theory it belongs to, how often it is visited/researched by an researcher and whether it was just fully researched (turned red in the current round).

### Defining the attack relation

On the created landscape an attack relation is added. Each argument has, with attack-probability corresponding to the theory the argument belongs to, an incoming attack from an argument belonging to another theory. Once the random attacks are created, the best theory (theory 0), has to make sure that it is fully defended. It creates attacks to arguments that attack one of its arguments, until it has defended all its attacked arguments.

### researchers

researchers are randomly distributed over the available theories. Then they form "collaborator-networks". If the switch "within-theory" is on in the interface, such networks are created with researchers that start on the same theory, if the switch is off networks are randomly created. Such networks have at most 5 researchers. In case the networks are random all networks have exactly 5 researchers, if the networks are created within theories there can be networks with less than 5 researchers.

A list of all collaborator-networks is saved in the global variable colla-networks:

`[[(researchers a1) ... (researcher a5)] ... [(researcher i1) ... (researcher i5)] ... ]`

The collaborator-networks are connected to each other, according to the choice in the interface: cycle (every network is connected to two other networs); wheel (every network is connected to two other networks and the royal network, which is connected to all other networks); or complete (every network is connected to every other network). These stuctures will be used when the representative researcher from one network communicates with representative researchers from other networks.

The social structures are saved in the global variable share-structure, which for the cycle has the form:

`[[[(researchers aa1) ... (researcher aa5)] ... [(researchers ac1) ... (researcher ac5)]] ... [[(researchers ia1) ... (researcher ia5)] ... [(researcher ic1) ... (researcher ic5)]] ... ]`

researchers have a memory in which they keep track of the following:

* _collaborator-network_: a list of at most four other researchers and itself that form the network it communicates with

* _subjective-relations_: a list of relations that an researcher knows of, an entry has three elements, the first is either an "a" (the relation is an attack) or an "d" (the relation is a discovery), the second is the argument from which the relation starts and the last element is the argument that is attacked/the child-argument:

`[["a" (argument attacking) (argument attacked)] ... ["d" (argument parent-argument) (argument child-argument)] ...]`

* _subjective-arguments_: a list of arguments that an researcher knows of, an entry has two elements: 1. the argument; 2. the color of the argument (this might be a color with higher value, less researched, than the current color, because it only remembers the color it saw/heard of):

`[[(argument a) colora] ... [(argument i) colori] ...]`

* _times-jumped_ and _theory-jump_: the first to keep track of how often researchers in general jump with a given strategy, the second to keep track of how often an researcher considers jumping

* _current-theory-info_: this list contains for each theory an entry that has the following elements, the second depending on the memory of the researcher: 1. the theory the entry belongs to; and 2. the number of admissible (not attacked) arguments:

`[[(start 0) ad0] [(start 2nd) ad2nd] ...]`

* _cur-best-th_: the current best theory according to the current memory of the researcher, this is updated every 5 time steps

* _th-args_ and th_relations_: lists of arguments and relations, that the researcher is prepared to share with researchers from other collaborative networks

* _to-add-mem-argu_ and _to-add-mem-rel_: lists of arguments and relations that the researcher has to add to its own memory as a result of communication

* _admissibile-subj-args_: the list of arguments from the subjective-arguments that are admissible (not attacked or attacked and defended)

* _neighborhood_: the neighboring arguments and relations of the argument it is currently working on

* _moved_: true if the researcher moved already in that time step

* _rep-researcher_ and _communicating_: if the researcher is in that communication round the representative researcher and how many time steps it takes this researcher to process all the new information it has obtained

## Basic behavior of researchers and the landscape

### Update of the memory

Every time step the researchers update their memory. The current argument is added to the list of subjective-arguments, then the relations are updated (including the subjective arguments that are discovered by these relations). The current argument, the relations to/from it and the arguments these relations connect belong to the neighborhood information of that argument and are saved in the memory of the researcher as "neighborargs".

Every five plus four time steps (4, 9, 14, ...), researchers share their memory with other researchers. First researchers share what they know within their own collaborator-network. In this network they share all information with everyone: after this round of sharing the researchers in the same network have the same memory.

After this, from every network one random researcher is chosen that will be the representative researcher of that network in communicating with other networks. These representative researchers create a list of arguments and a list of relations that they are prepared to share with other representative researchers. How this is done depends on the social behavior of the researchers (reliable or biased).

Then the representative researchers share the part of the memory they want to share with the researchers from the networks that neighbor their own in the network structure. The researchers collect all the new arguments and relations. At most 30 new entries are added to their memory and at most 10 entries per day.

The time step that the researchers share their information is already lost. Depending on how many new entries the value of the variable communicating is increased, with a maximum of three. For communicating time steps the researchers cannot do research: they do not move around and the landscape is not affected by their presence. Every fifth round (0, 5, 10, ...) all researchers do not communicate: every researcher can move around and affects the landscape.

After updating the memory and sharing information, the researcher removes all duplicate arguments from its memory. This also includes entries with arguments that were part of the memory but for which a new entry with better research color is found.

### researchers move around

Each time step researchers, that did not communicate with researchers from other networks and are not working on a not fully researched not-admissible argument, consider the arguments which they can work on next. Such an argument has to be a child-argument of the current argument, should be discovered, it should not be discovered by discovering an attack relation that involves the argument, it should not be red with another researcher already working on it and the discovery relation should be discovered as well.

The probability that an researcher moves to such a possible next argument depends on the color of the argument it is currently working on (but the color influences this probability only a little) and the time step. Every time step an researcher moves with a probability of 1/5 of the total move-probability to a next argument. Every 5th time step (5, 10, 15, ...) the researcher moves with the full move-probability that is set in the interface.

If an researcher is working on an argument that is fully researched, the color is red, it will try to move to a next argument, if that is not possible, it will move one step back (if no other researcher is working on that argument) and if that is not possible, it will move to a discovered, not fully researched and attacked argument in the same theory with no researcher working on it.

researchers, that did not communicate and are working on a not fully researched and not-admissible argument try to find a defense for their argument. This is done by staying on the current argument until it is red (then everything is discovered that can be discovered) or a defense from one of its child-arguments is discovered. Such a defense attack does not have to be discovered yet. If such a defending-child-argument exists, the researcher will move to this argument. researchers that move like this cannot move in the regular way that time step.

### Update of the landscape

The landscape is updated every five time steps (5, 10, 15, ...). A new child-argument becomes visible for arguments that are yellow, brown, orange or red and still have an undiscovered child-argument. With visibility-probability (depending a little bit, even less than with the move probability, on the color) attacks are discovered. First the in-attacks, then the out-attacks.

If researchers have been working for research-speed time steps on an argument, the argument changes color, if the argument was not yet fully researched. Discovery relations that connect two non-gray colored arguments (one may be turquoise, discovered by attack) are also discovered.

An argument that was fully researched in this time step (it turned red), discovers immediately all its relations: attacks and discoveries + the other ends.

## Strategies

### Computations for the strategies

After updating the memory of the researchers, researchers will reconsider working on the theory they are working on. How they do this depends on the strategy. The criterion on which they base this is the number of admissible arguments of the theory: the number of discovered, admissible arguments (they may be attacked, but then they are also defended).

Each researcher computes for its "current-theory-info" the number of admissible arguments, with respect to its current memory. Based on the information from the current-theory-info the best theory is calculated. The best theory can be unique, in that case there is no other theory that has a number of admissible arguments that is close enough to the number of admissible arguments of this best theory (close enough depends on the "strategy-threshold" in the interface).

### Acting on the strategy

Once the current best theory is computed, researchers will reconsider the theory they are working on. If that is not the current best theory, they consider to jump.

If researchers think often enough that they should jump to another theory, often enough depends on the "jump-threshold" of the interface, the researcher jumps to a/the current best theory and starts working on that theory. If the researcher is aware of an argument from that theory, it will jump to a random, argument of that theory in its memory, otherwise it will jump to the root.
